    <h3>Roadmap to 2024 <br> A Journey to My Best Self</h3>

    <p>

This blog marks a big step for me—my first time writing about my personal journey in this portfolio, capturing a year that changed me in profound ways.
<br>
<h5>February, My Lowest Point</h5>
The year began on a rough note. In February, I faced a significant problem caused by a friend’s mistake. It took a toll on my mental health, and I needed more than two months to recover. During this tough time, I chose to keep everything to myself—even my parents had no idea what I was going through.

<br><br>
To protect myself, I distanced myself from someone I liked for four months without giving her any explanation. This made her think I was just another guy who disappears without a word. She never knew the real reason behind my silence. A part of me hopes that someday she’ll read this and understand what truly happened.
<h5>June, a fresh start</h5>
By June, the storm had passed, and I found the strength to rise again. That month marked the beginning of something extraordinary. I started a TikTok-based company offering academic assistance services, and to my surprise, it took off beyond my expectations. The company achieved remarkable success, earning consistent two-digit income within just a month, you can visited this url <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@satupersenhelperr?_t=ZS-8sfnJC8oqQx&_r=1">Click</a>.

But beyond the financial success, what truly made me proud was being able to create job opportunities, especially for postgraduate students specializing in skripsi work. It felt incredible to support others while building something meaningful for myself.
<br>
<br>
<h5>A Scholarship to Lighten the Burden</h5>
In addition to my business success, I was fortunate to receive the Karawang Cerdas scholarship as recognition for my achievements in various competitions. This scholarship significantly reduced my family’s financial burdens, particularly my university tuition fees. It was a blessing that gave me the space to focus on personal growth without constantly worrying about money
<br>
<br>
<h5>Hopes for 2025</h5>
Now, as 2024 comes to an end, I’m looking ahead to 2025 with hope and optimism. I dream of a year filled with beauty and true happiness—whether it’s financial stability, love, or inner peace. I want to keep moving forward, building a life that is not just successful but also meaningful.
This is my roadmap to becoming the best version of myself, one step at a time. Here's to the journey ahead.
