    <h3>Roadmap to 2024 <br> A Journey to My Best Self</h3>

    <p>

This blog marks a significant milestone for me—it's the first time I’m writing on my portfolio, documenting a year that transformed me in unimaginable ways.
<br>
<h5>February, A Storm That Shook Me</h5>
The year started on a challenging note. In February, I faced a massive issue caused by a foolish mistake made by a friend. This incident deeply affected my mental health, and it took me more than two months to recover. During this time, I kept everything to myself—my parents had no idea about the struggles I endured, and only I truly understood the depths of my pain.

<br><br>
To protect myself, I distanced myself from someone I liked for four months without giving her any clear explanation. Unfortunately, this led her to think I was just another guy who ghosts people. she never knew the real reason behind my silence. A part of me hopes she might read this journey one day and realize what I went through.
<br><br>
<h5>June, Rising from the Ashes</h5>
By June, the storm had passed, and I found the strength to rise again. That month marked the beginning of something extraordinary. I started a TikTok-based company offering academic assistance services, and to my surprise, it took off beyond my expectations. The company achieved remarkable success, earning consistent two-digit income within just a month, you can visited this url <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@satupersenhelperr?_t=ZS-8sfnJC8oqQx&_r=1">Click</a>.

But beyond the financial success, what truly made me proud was being able to create job opportunities, especially for postgraduate students specializing in thesis work. It felt incredible to support others while building something meaningful for myself.
<br>
<br>
<h5>A Scholarship to Lighten the Burden</h5>
In addition to the success of my company, I was honored to receive the Karawang Cerdas scholarship, a reward for my achievements in competitions. This scholarship significantly eased my family’s financial burdens, especially when it came to covering my university tuition fees. It was a blessing that allowed me to focus more on my growth without the constant worry about money.

<br>
<br>
<h5>Hopes for 2025</h5>
As 2024 comes to a close, I look forward to 2025 with hope and optimism. I dream of a year filled with beauty and true happiness—whether it’s in terms of financial stability, love, or inner peace. I aim to continue building on this journey, creating a life that is not just successful but also meaningful and fulfilling.

This is my roadmap to becoming the best version of myself, one step at a time. Here's to the journey ahead.
